This DSL approach to describing\n   * animations allows for a flexibility that both benefits developers and the framework.\n   *\n   * Animations work by listening on state changes that occur on an element within\n   * the template. When a state change occurs, Angular can then take advantage and animate the\n   * arc in between. This works similar to how CSS transitions work, however, by having a\n   * programmatic DSL, animations are not limited to environments that are DOM-specific.\n   * (Angular can also perform optimizations behind the scenes to make animations more performant.)\n   *\n   * For animations to be available for use, animation state changes are placed within\n   * {@link trigger animation triggers} which are housed inside of the `animations` annotation\n   * metadata. Within a trigger both {@link state state} and {@link transition transition} entries\n   * can be placed.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'animation-cmp',\n   *   templateUrl: 'animation-cmp.html',\n   *   animations: [\n   *     // this here is our animation trigger that\n   *     // will contain our state change animations.\n   *     trigger('myTriggerName', [\n   *       // the styles defined for the `on` and `off`\n   *       // states declared below are persisted on the\n   *       // element once the animation completes.\n   *       state('on', style({ opacity: 1 }),\n   *       state('off', style({ opacity: 0 }),\n   *\n   *       // this here is our animation that kicks off when\n   *       // this state change jump is true\n   *       transition('on => off', [\n   *         animate(\"1s\")\n   *       ])\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As depicted in the code above, a group of related animation states are all contained within\n   * an animation `trigger` (the code example above called the trigger `myTriggerName`).\n   * When a trigger is created then it can be bound onto an element within the component's\n   * template via a property prefixed by an `@` symbol followed by trigger name and an expression\n   * that\n   * is used to determine the state value for that trigger.\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <!-- animation-cmp.html -->\n   * <div @myTriggerName=\"expression\">...</div>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * For state changes to be executed, the `expression` value must change value from its existing\n   * value\n   * to something that we have set an animation to animate on (in the example above we are listening\n   * to a change of state between `on` and `off`). The `expression` value attached to the trigger\n   * must be something that can be evaluated with the template/component context.\n   *\n   * ### DSL Animation Functions\n   *\n   * Please visit each of the animation DSL functions listed below to gain a better understanding\n   * of how and why they are used for crafting animations in Angular:\n   *\n   * - {@link trigger trigger()}\n   * - {@link state state()}\n   * - {@link transition transition()}\n   * - {@link group group()}\n   * - {@link sequence sequence()}\n   * - {@link style style()}\n   * - {@link animate animate()}\n   * - {@link keyframes keyframes()}\n   */\n  animations?: any[];\n\n  /**\n   * Specifies how the template and the styles should be encapsulated:\n   * - {@link ViewEncapsulation#Native `ViewEncapsulation.Native`} to use shadow roots - only works\n   *   if natively available on the platform,\n   * - {@link ViewEncapsulation#Emulated `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`} to use shimmed CSS that\n   *   emulates the native behavior,\n   * - {@link ViewEncapsulation#None `ViewEncapsulation.None`} to use global CSS without any\n   *   encapsulation.\n   *\n   * When no `encapsulation` is defined for the component, the default value from the\n   * {@link CompilerOptions} is used.

If you want to change the default setting for all components\n   * in your application you can use the `preserveWhitespaces` option of the AOT compiler.\n   *\n   * Even if you decide to opt-in for whitespace removal there are ways of preserving whitespaces\n   * in certain fragments of a template. You can either exclude entire DOM sub-tree by using the\n   * `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute, ex.:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <div ngPreserveWhitespaces>\n   *     whitespaces are preserved here\n   *     <span>    and here </span>\n   * </div>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Alternatively you can force a space to be preserved in a text node by using the `&ngsp;`\n   * pseudo-entity. `&ngsp;` will be replaced with a space character by Angular's template\n   * compiler, ex.:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <a>Spaces</a>&ngsp;<a>between</a>&ngsp;<a>links.</a>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * will be compiled to the equivalent of:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <a>Spaces</a> <a>between</a> <a>links.</a>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Please note that sequences of `&ngsp;` are still collapsed to just one space character when\n   * the `preserveWhitespaces` option is set to `false`. Ex.:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <a>before</a>&ngsp;&ngsp;&ngsp;<a>after</a>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * would be equivalent to:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <a>before</a> <a>after</a>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * The `&ngsp;` pseudo-entity is useful for forcing presence of\n   * one space (a text node having `&ngsp;` pseudo-entities will never be removed), but it is not\n   * meant to mark sequences of whitespace characters. The previously described\n   * `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute is more useful for preserving sequences of whitespace\n   * characters.\n   */\n  preserveWhitespaces?: boolean;\n}\n/**\n * Component decorator and metadata.\n * \n * \\@stable\n * \\@Annotation\n */\nexport const Component: ComponentDecorator = <ComponentDecorator>makeDecorator(\n    'Component', (c: Component = {}) => ({changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default, ...c}),\n    Directive);\n\n/**\n * Type of the Pipe decorator / constructor function.\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport interface PipeDecorator {\n  /**\n   * Declare reusable pipe function.\n   *\n   * A \"pure\" pipe is only re-evaluated when either the input or any of the arguments change.\n   *\n   * When not specified, pipes default to being pure.\n   */\n  (obj: Pipe): TypeDecorator;\n\n  /**\n   * See the {@link Pipe} decorator.\n   */\n  new (obj: Pipe): Pipe;\n}\n\n/**\n * Type of the Pipe metadata.\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport interface Pipe {\n  name: string;\n  pure?: boolean;\n}\n/**\n * Pipe decorator and metadata.\n * \n * \\@stable\n * \\@Annotation\n */\nexport const Pipe: PipeDecorator =\n    <PipeDecorator>makeDecorator('Pipe', (p: Pipe) => ({pure: true, ...p}));\n\n\n/**\n * Type of the Input decorator / constructor function.\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport interface InputDecorator {\n  /**\n   * Declares a data-bound input property.\n   *\n   * Angular automatically updates data-bound properties during change detection.\n   *\n   * `Input` takes an optional parameter that specifies the name\n   * used when instantiating a component in the template.

If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better\n * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.\n * \n * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n * \n * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the\n * {\\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element\n * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that\n * the\n * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\\@triggerName]=\"expression\"`.\n * \n * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against\n * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both\n * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values\n * respectively.\n * \n * ### Usage\n * \n * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The\n * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} declarations.\n * \n * ```typescript\n * \\@Component({ \n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n * \n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n * \n * ## Disable Animations\n * A special animation control binding called `\\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will\n * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as\n * any animations on the element itself.\n * \n * When true, the `\\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example\n * below shows how to use this feature:\n * \n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({ \n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * The `\\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\\@.disabled` prevents it from happening\n * (when true).\n * \n * Note that `\\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on\n * the same element will also be disabled).\n * \n * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will\n * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular\n * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular\n * component.\n * \n * ```ts\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\\@angular/core';\n * \n * \\@Component({ \n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   \\@HostBinding('\\@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\\@link query query} for inner\n * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit.

It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n * \n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n * \n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n * \n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n * \n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence.

The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set\n * to query for each of the inner items.\n * \n * ```html\n * <!-- list.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"toggle()\">Show / Hide Items</button>\n * <hr />\n * <div [\\@listAnimation]=\"items.length\">\n *   <div *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n *     {{ item }}\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n * \n * The component code for this looks as such:\n * \n * ```ts\n * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({ \n *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('listAnimation', [\n *        //...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ListComponent {\n *   items = [];\n * \n *   showItems() {\n *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];\n *   }\n * \n *   hideItems() {\n *     this.items = [];\n *   }\n * \n *   toggle() {\n *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * And now for the animation trigger code:\n * \n * ```ts\n * trigger('listAnimation', [\n *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes\n *     query(':leave', [\n *       stagger(100, [\n *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     query(':enter', [\n *       style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *       stagger(100, [\n *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ])\n * ])\n * ```\n * \n * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity\n * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.\n * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be\n * applied after each item's animation is started.\n * \n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?} animation\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function stagger(\n    timings: string | number,\n    animation: AnimationMetadata | AnimationMetadata[]): AnimationStaggerMetadata {\n  return {type: AnimationMetadataType.Stagger, timings, animation};\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../../../../packages/core/src/animation/dsl.ts","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n   * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n * \n * ### Local Variables\n * \n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n * \n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n * \n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Change Propagation\n * \n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n * \n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n * \n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n * \n * ## Most common usage\n * \n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n * \n * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`\n * \n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n * \n * ## Using non-inlined `then` template\n * \n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n * \n * ## Storing conditional result in a variable\n * \n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:\n * \n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n * \n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n * \n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n * \n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n * \n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value;

It encodes inheritance, properties, and events.\n *\n * ## Overview\n *\n * Each line represents one kind of element. The `element_inheritance` and properties are joined\n * using `element_inheritance|properties` syntax.\n *\n * ## Element Inheritance\n *\n * The `element_inheritance` can be further subdivided as `element1,element2,...^parentElement`.\n * Here the individual elements are separated by `,` (commas). Every element in the list\n * has identical properties.\n *\n * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is\n * specified then `\"\"` (blank) element is assumed.\n *\n * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `[Element]` element, the super element of all\n * elements.\n *\n * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.\n *\n * ## Properties\n *\n * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed\n * by a special character designating its type:\n *\n * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n * - `*`: property represents an event.\n * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n * - `#`: property is a number.\n * - `%`: property is an object.\n *\n * ## Query\n *\n * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n * if a given property exist on a given element.\n *\n * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n */\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n// =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n//\n//                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n//\n// Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n// dom_security_schema.ts.

You do\n * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.\n * \n * ### How to use select controls with form directives\n * \n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\n * \n * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property\n * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run.

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n * \n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n * \n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n * \n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n * \n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n * \n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n * \n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n * \n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n * \n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n * \n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgModel extends NgControl implements OnChanges,\n    OnDestroy {\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_control = new FormControl();\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_registered = false;\n  viewModel: any;\n\n   name: string;\n   isDisabled: boolean;\n   model: any;\n   options: {name?: string, standalone?: boolean};\n\n   update = new EventEmitter();\n/**\n * @param {?} parent\n * @param {?} validators\n * @param {?} asyncValidators\n * @param {?} valueAccessors\n */\nconstructor(  parent: ControlContainer,\n                 validators: Array<Validator|ValidatorFn>,\n                 asyncValidators: Array<AsyncValidator|AsyncValidatorFn>,\n                \n              valueAccessors: ControlValueAccessor[]) {\n                super();\n                this._parent = parent;\n                this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n                this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n                this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n              }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {\n                this._checkForErrors();\n                if (!this._registered) this._setUpControl();\n                if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n                  this._updateDisabled(changes);\n                }\n\n                if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n                  this._updateValue(this.model);\n                  this.viewModel = this.model;\n                }\n              }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnDestroy(): void { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget control(): FormControl { return this._control; }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget path(): string[] {\n                return this._parent ?

If no input Observables are provided, resulting stream will complete\n   * immediately.\n   *\n   * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed Observables to complete and then it will emit an array with last\n   * values from corresponding Observables. So if you pass `n` Observables to the operator, resulting\n   * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first Observable,\n   * second value is the last thing emitted by the second Observable and so on. That means `forkJoin` will\n   * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only\n   * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}\n   * or {@link zip} instead.\n   *\n   * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of\n   * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well\n   * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.\n   * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,\n   * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to\n   * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all Observables passed as arguments\n   * have to emit something at least once and complete.\n   *\n   * If any input Observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other Observables\n   * will be immediately unsubscribed.\n   *\n   * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally\n   * would land in emitted array.

Each one has the following properties:\n *\n * - `path` is a string that uses the route matcher DSL.\n * - `pathMatch` is a string that specifies the matching strategy.\n * - `matcher` defines a custom strategy for path matching and supersedes `path` and `pathMatch`.\n * - `component` is a component type.\n * - `redirectTo` is the url fragment which will replace the current matched segment.\n * - `outlet` is the name of the outlet the component should be placed into.\n * - `canActivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivate} for more info.\n * - `canActivateChild` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivateChild handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivateChild} for more info.\n * - `canDeactivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanDeactivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanDeactivate} for more info.\n * - `canLoad` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanLoad handlers. See\n *   {@link CanLoad} for more info.\n * - `data` is additional data provided to the component via `ActivatedRoute`.\n * - `resolve` is a map of DI tokens used to look up data resolvers. See {@link Resolve} for more\n *   info.\n * - `runGuardsAndResolvers` defines when guards and resolvers will be run. By default they run only\n *    when the matrix parameters of the route change. When set to `paramsOrQueryParamsChange` they\n *    will also run when query params change. And when set to `always`, they will run every time.\n * - `children` is an array of child route definitions.\n * - `loadChildren` is a reference to lazy loaded child routes. See {@link LoadChildren} for more\n *   info.\n *\n * ### Simple Configuration\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n  *  component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/bob`, the router will create the team component with the user\n * component in it.\n *\n * ### Multiple Outlets\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team\n * }, {\n *   path: 'chat/:user',\n *   component: Chat\n *   outlet: 'aux'\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11(aux:chat/jim)`, the router will create the team component next to\n * the chat component. The chat component will be placed into the aux outlet.\n *\n * ### Wild Cards\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '**',\n *   component: Sink\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Regardless of where you navigate to, the router will instantiate the sink component.\n *\n * ### Redirects\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'legacy/user/:name',\n *     redirectTo: 'user/:name'\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to '/team/11/legacy/user/jim', the router will change the url to\n * '/team/11/user/jim', and then will instantiate the team component with the user component\n * in it.\n *\n * If the `redirectTo` value starts with a '/', then it is an absolute redirect. E.g., if in the\n * example above we change the `redirectTo` to `/user/:name`, the result url will be '/user/jim'.\n *\n * ### Empty Path\n *\n * Empty-path route configurations can be used to instantiate components that do not 'consume'\n * any url segments. Let's look at the following configuration:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: AllUsers\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11`, the router will instantiate the AllUsers component.\n *\n * Empty-path routes can have children.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: WrapperCmp,\n *     children: [{\n *       path: 'user/:name',\n *       component: User\n *     }]\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/jim`, the router will instantiate the wrapper component with\n * the user component in it.\n *\n * An empty path route inherits its parent's params and data. This is because it cannot have its\n * own params, and, as a result, it often uses its parent's params and data as its own.\n *\n * ### Matching Strategy\n *\n * By default the router will look at what is left in the url, and check if it starts with\n * the specified path (e.g., `/team/11/user` starts with `team/:id`).\n *\n * We can change the matching strategy to make sure that the path covers the whole unconsumed url,\n * which is akin to `unconsumedUrl === path` or `$` regular expressions.\n *\n * This is particularly important when redirecting empty-path routes.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'prefix', //default\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Since an empty path is a prefix of any url, even when navigating to '/main', the router will\n * still apply the redirect.\n *\n * If `pathMatch: full` is provided, the router will apply the redirect if and only if navigating to\n * '/'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'full',\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Componentless Routes\n *\n * It is useful at times to have the ability to share parameters between sibling components.\n *\n * Say we have two components--ChildCmp and AuxCmp--that we want to put next to each other and both\n * of them require some id parameter.\n *\n * One way to do that would be to have a bogus parent component, so both the siblings can get the id\n * parameter from it. This is not ideal. Instead, you can use a componentless route.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: 'a', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: 'b', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * So when navigating to `parent/10/(a//aux:b)`, the route will instantiate the main child and aux\n * child components next to each other. In this example, the application component\n * has to have the primary and aux outlets defined.\n *\n * The router will also merge the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the componentless parent into\n * the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the children. This is done because there is no component\n * that can inject the activated route of the componentless parent.\n *\n * This is especially useful when child components are defined as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: '', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: '', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * With this configuration in place, navigating to '/parent/10' will create the main child and aux\n * components.\n *\n * ### Lazy Loading\n *\n * Lazy loading speeds up our application load time by splitting it into multiple bundles, and\n * loading them on demand.

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function observeOn<T>(scheduler: IScheduler, delay: number = 0): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T> {\n  return function observeOnOperatorFunction(source: Observable<T>): Observable<T> {\n    return source.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n  };\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\n  constructor(private scheduler: IScheduler, private delay: number = 0) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): TeardownLogic {\n    return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\n  static dispatch(this: Action<ObserveOnMessage>, arg: ObserveOnMessage) {\n    const { notification, destination } = arg;\n    notification.observe(destination);\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\n              private scheduler: IScheduler,\n              private delay: number = 0) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  private scheduleMessage(notification: Notification<any>): void {\n    this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(\n      ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch,\n      this.delay,\n      new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)\n    ));\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\n  }\n\n  protected _error(err: any): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\n  }\n\n  protected _complete(): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\n  }\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnMessage {\n  constructor(public notification: Notification<any>,\n              public destination: PartialObserver<any>) {\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../../src/operators/observeOn.ts","import { PartialObserver } from './Observer';\nimport { Observable } from './Observable';\n\n/**\n * Represents a push-based event or value that an {@link Observable} can emit.\n * This class is particularly useful for operators that manage notifications,\n * like {@link materialize}, {@link dematerialize}, {@link observeOn}, and\n * others.
